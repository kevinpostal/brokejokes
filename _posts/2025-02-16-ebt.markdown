Let’s be real: Being broke in California is like playing life on “expert mode.” Between avocado toast inflation and rent that costs more than a spaceship lease, we all need a little help keeping our pantries stocked. Enter **EBT** – the Golden State’s way of saying, “Here’s a snack, go survive another day.”

### What Even is EBT? (And Can It Buy Me Sushi?)  
EBT = **Electronic Benefit Transfer**, aka your new best friend. In California, it’s called **CalFresh** (fancy, right?). Think of it like a debit card the government loads with free money for groceries.  

**What you CAN buy:**  
✅ Groceries (bread, milk, veggies, even seeds to grow your own!)  
✅ Snacks (yes, chips count – this is America)  
❌ Hot meals, alcohol, or pet food (RIP, Fido’s steak dreams)

### The “Are You Broke Enough?” Checklist  
To qualify for EBT in California, you basically need to:  
1. Make less money than a TikTok influencer’s first brand deal  
2. Be a human (or a very convincing alien)  

**2023 Income Limits (for 1 person):**  
- **$1,473/month** gross income  
- **$1,133/month** net income  

*Translation:* If your bank account looks like 🚨💸🚨 after paying rent, you’re probably eligible.
